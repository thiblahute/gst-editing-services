		<h1>Goals of GStreamer Editing Services</h1>
<p>The GStreamer multimedia framework and the accompanying GNonLin set of
plugins for non-linear editing offer all the building blocks for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Decoding and encoding to a wide variety of formats, through all the
available GStreamer plugins.</p></li>
<li><p>Easily choosing segments of streams and arranging them through time
through the GNonLin set of plugins.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But all those building blocks only offer stream-level access, which
results in developers who want to write non-linear editors to write a
consequent amount of code to get to the level of <em>non-linear editing</em>
notions which are closer and more meaningful for the end-user (and
therefore the application).</p>
<p>The GStreamer Editing Services (hereafter GES) aims to fill the gap
between GStreamer/GNonLin and the application developer by offering a
series of classes to simplify the creation of many kind of
editing-related applications.</p>
<h1>Architecture</h1>
<h2>Timeline and TimelinePipeline</h2>
<p>The most top-level object encapsulating every other object is the
<a href="#GESTimeline">GESTimeline</a>. It is the central object for any editing
project.</p>
<p>The <code>GESTimeline</code> is a <code>GstElement</code>. It can therefore be used in any
GStreamer pipeline like any other object.</p>
<h2>Tracks and Layers</h2>
<p>The GESTimeline can contain two types of objects (seen in ?):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Layers - Corresponds to the user-visible arrangement of clips, and
what you primarily interact with as an application developer. A
minimalistic timeline would only have one layer, but a more complex
editing application could use as many as needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Tracks - Corresponds to the output streams in GStreamer. A typical
GESTimeline, aimed at a video editing application, would have an
audio track and a video track. A GESTimeline for an audio editing
application would only require an audio track. Multiple layers can
be related to each track.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In order to reduce even more the amount of GStreamer interaction the
application developer has to deal with, a convenience GstPipeline has
been made available specifically for Timelines :
